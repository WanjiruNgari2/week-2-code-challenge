# week-2-code-challenge
This challenge will remind the student how to use HTML and CSS. It will also require the student to showcase their understanding of JavaScript Language. Thereafter, students will use DOM manipulation to ataach all files together so they form  a pefect shopping list.
## HTML
students will use HTML to form list containers, add button, clear button and purchased button. They will also link javascript files that will be used to further 'style' the shopping list.
## CSS
This list will require a little bit of style to be functional but the student may decide to beautify even further if they so wish. We only require a change of color if the user clicks on a product that was already purchased and a strikethruough that particular item.
## Javascript
 This will test the students mastery of functions, arrays, DOM manipulation, adding listeners and returning required result. Its okay to be wrong, so feel free to go back to previous labs and assignments for better coding.
